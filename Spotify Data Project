For this project, I received data from Spotify.
From there on, I inserted the data into a table and created questions to query. 

CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

SELECT * FROM Spotifydata

-- List the most to least popular track names with the artists' names and track ids.
SELECT artist_name
,track_name
,track_id
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity DESC
;

-- What artist released the longest song?
SELECT artist_name
,track_name
,duration_ms
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata 
ORDER BY duration_ms 
LIMIT 1
;

-- What is the average duration for the top 10 most popular songs?
SELECT AVG (duration_ms) AS AvgDurationMsForTop10
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 10
;

-- List all songs by Doja Cat found in this database.
SELECT artist_name
,track_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE artist_name = 'Doja Cat'
;

-- What songs have a danceability less than 0.5?
SELECT artist_name
,track_name
,danceability
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE danceability < 0.5
;
