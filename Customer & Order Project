-- Here you'll see the SQL coding I practiced with my Customer & Order Project. This database shared statistics and data about customers and their order details. 

-- How many orders were placed in January?

-- How many of those orders were for an iPhone (JanSales)?
SELECT COUNT (orderid)

WHERE Product = 'iPhone'
AND LENGTH (orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

-- Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT DISTINCT acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers cust
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
ON cust.order_id = Feb.orderid
WHERE LENGTH (orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

-- Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT DISTINCT product
,price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
ORDER BY price ASC
LIMIT 1;

-- What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT SUM (quantity)*price AS revenue
,product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product;

--Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT SUM (quantity)

FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'

-- How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT COUNT (DISTINCT cust.acctnum)
